This process is known as gravitational collapse. When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer support its own weight and gravitational forces become so strong that it collapses into a black hole.\n\nBlack holes are characterized by several key features:\n\n* **Event horizon:** The event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape. It is the point of no return.\n* **Singularity:** The singularity is the point at the center of a black hole at which the gravitational forces become infinite.\n* **No hair theorem:** The no hair theorem states that black holes are characterized by their mass and angular momentum, but they have no other distinguishing features.\n* **Gravitational lensing:** Black holes bend light around them, causing it to form a ring of light around the black hole.\n* **\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":36},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
